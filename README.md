# MLOps

This repository contains files for my MLOps projects, which is a field I have great interest in given the vast practical applications it has across industries. As I learn more about MLOps concepts and workflows, I will try to practice implementing them on my own at a smaller scale. 

I am currently working on one MLOps project related to individual household power consumption in France. To handle production, deployment and experiment tracking, I will be utilising ZenML and MLFlow, and I plan to learn about different but functionally similar platforms in future.
